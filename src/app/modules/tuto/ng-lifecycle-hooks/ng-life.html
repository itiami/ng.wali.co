                In Angular, the lifecycle of a component follows a specific order, which dictates the sequence in which
                the blocks of code in your example will execute. Here's the order listed for your TestComponent:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="font-bold">Block_3 (Constructor):</span> The constructor is always the first part of any
                class
                to be
                executed. In Angular
                components, this is where you generally set up initial values for properties and do the basic class
                setup. In your code, this.time_1 is assigned a value here.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="font-bold">Block_1 (Property Initialization):</span> The property time_2 is initialized
                immediately after the
                constructor.
                This is where class properties are set up with their initial values. In Angular, this happens before the
                Angular-specific lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="font-bold">Block_4 (ngOnInit Lifecycle Hook):</span> The ngOnInit method is a lifecycle
                hook in
                Angular that
                is called
                after Angular has finished initializing all data-bound properties of a directive. This is where you
                typically put initialization logic for the component. In your code, this is where console.log statements
                are executed and where the testFn() method is called.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="font-bold">Block_2 (Method Declaration):</span> The testFn method is simply a declaration
                and
                does not
                execute on its own.
                It only runs when called. In your example, it is called during the ngOnInit phase.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the execution order is as follows:
            </p>

            <ul class="ml-5 list-inside list-decimal marker:text-[#e08e8e] marker:font-bold marker:text-lg">
                <li>Constructor (Block_3)</li>
                <li>Property Initialization (Block_1)</li>
                <li>ngOnInit (Block_4) </li>
                <li>Method Call within ngOnInit (Block_2 is executed as part of Block_4 when testFn is called)</li>
            </ul>
